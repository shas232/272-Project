# Expense Fraud Detection

An AI-driven platform designed to detect fraudulent or unusual employee expenses within an organization. By leveraging machine learning and anomaly detection techniques, this system flags suspicious transactions, learns from employee spending behavior, and provides valuable insights into potential fraud patterns across departments or locations. The platform helps reduce the risk of financial losses and improves the integrity of organizational financial processes.

## Overview

This project implements an AI-driven platform to help organizations detect and mitigate fraudulent employee expenses. Using machine learning models and anomaly detection techniques, the platform flags suspicious transactions, allowing HR and finance teams to investigate potential fraud. It offers a comprehensive dashboard to review flagged expenses and track spending trends across departments or locations.

## Features

### Anomaly Detection

The system detects outliers in employee spending based on their historical expense data. This helps to identify expenses that deviate significantly from normal spending patterns.

### Fraud Pattern Recognition

The platform identifies common fraudulent spending patterns across various departments or locations, enabling proactive detection of suspicious claims.

### Real-time Alerts

The system sends notifications whenever suspicious transactions are detected, providing HR and finance teams with immediate alerts for further investigation.

### Reporting and Dashboards

Visual insights are provided into trends, department-level anomalies, and fraud hotspots. The comprehensive dashboard enables easy monitoring of flagged expenses, helping HR and finance teams quickly identify and address unusual or potentially fraudulent claims.

## How It Works

Employees can upload their expense reports, receipts, and transaction details through the platform. Once submitted, the system processes the data and flags any anomalies or potential fraud using advanced AI models.

HR and finance teams can access a detailed dashboard where flagged transactions can be reviewed. This helps teams to quickly spot fraudulent claims and analyze spending patterns across the organization. The platform continuously learns from historical data, improving its accuracy over time.
